# Note-Taker
An application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes.

## Functionality
This application uses an express backend to save and retrieve note data from a JSON file stored on a server. Notes are dynamically rendered from the file onto the web page. This approach allows for persistent data outside of the browser.

## Access

--OR "localhost:3000/" if you have downloaded onto your machine and have started the server ("node server.js").
